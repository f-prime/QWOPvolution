# About

This project implements a Genetic Algorithm that learns how to play QWOP. So far it can beat the game... but it runs very slowly.

# Requirements

- Python 3
- Selenium
- PyTesseract
- Firefox
- PIL

# Run it

You'll need to install the requirements file (`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`) then just running `genetic_qwop.py` with `python3 genetic_qwop.py` should work.
